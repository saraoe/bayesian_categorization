# Bayesian Categorization

The ability to form categories is essential for understanding external input and plays an important role in human reasoning and decision-making. Many studies of categorization have focused on modeling categorization performed by individuals however literature investigating groups performing this task is sparse. Humans are social beings, thus, it would be relevant to investigate how categorization are performed during social interactions. In this thesis, we want to extend and evaluate the generalized context model (GCM; Nosofsky, 1986) on empirical data of interpersonal categorization.
